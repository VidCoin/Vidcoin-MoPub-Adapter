## General instructions
To integrate Vidcoin in your MoPub ad serving flow, you will need:
- A publisher account on Vidcoin's platform
- At least one app on Vidcoin's platform
- A placement for each of your apps on Vidcoin's platform

### Account and app creation

  1. Create an account on [https://manager.vidcoin.com](https://manager.vidcoin.com), and fill in all the required information.
  2. Create one or multiple apps on the platform.
  3. For each individual app, create a placement (corresponding to a zone in your app where you want to serve video ads).

Once this is done, you can proceed to the technical integration.

### Technical integration
You can now head to the appropriate folder in this repository, depending on the technology your app uses (iOS, Android or Unity). You may also need to refer to our repositories for [Vidcoin iOS SDK](https://github.com/VidCoin/VidCoin-iOS-SDK), [Vidcoin Android SDK](https://github.com/VidCoin/VidCoin-Android-SDK) and [Vidcoin Unity SDK](https://github.com/VidCoin/VidCoin-Unity-SDK).
